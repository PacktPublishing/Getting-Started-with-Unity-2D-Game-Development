# Getting Started with Unity 2D Game Development [Video]
This is the code repository for [Getting Started with Unity 2D Game Development [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/getting-started-unity-2d-game-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787120884), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video will help you build 2D games in Unity using the engine's 2D technologies based on Version 5.x. 
You will be shown how to get up-and-running with Unity 5.4.1, including the basic steps to choose the appropriate edition and install the software. You will also be shown how to find older versions of Unity and learn about the key differences compared to previous versions.

To start with, you will learn the introductory information needed to work in Unity 2D game development. The video describes the process of setting up a project in 2D mode, covers the use of 2D sprites, discusses ways to access 2D objects via code, and explains the basics of the User Interface. It then covers the very first game genre—text adventure—and you will go on to create an example of this with the various elements discussed earlier in the chapter.

Once you reach the end and have produced a text adventure game, you can go back to the challenges included in each chapter and use them to improve the game and your 2D game development skills!
